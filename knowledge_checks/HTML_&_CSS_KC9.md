### Knowledge Check: Mastering Layout with CSS Flexbox

#### Objective:
To gain hands-on experience with CSS Flexbox by using it to create flexible and responsive layouts on your webpage.

#### Tools Needed:
- Text editor (already installed).
- Web browser.

#### Instructions:

**1. Review Flexbox Concepts:**
- Understand the basics of Flexbox, including the concepts of flex container and flex items.
- Familiarize yourself with key Flexbox properties like `display: flex;`, `flex-direction`, `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `flex-wrap`.

**2. Select Layout Elements:**
- Identify elements on your webpage that would benefit from a Flexbox layout, such as navigation bars, image galleries, card layouts, or footer sections.

**3. Create a Flex Container:**
- Choose an element (like a `<div>`) to act as a flex container.
- Apply `display: flex;` to this container to initiate Flexbox layout.

**4. Experiment with Flex Items:**
- Inside your flex container, work with child elements (flex items).
- Experiment with the order and alignment of these items using Flexbox properties.
- Adjust the `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis` properties to control the sizing of flex items.

**5. Manipulate Flex Direction:**
- Use the `flex-direction` property to arrange items horizontally or vertically.
- Experiment with values like `row`, `column`, `row-reverse`, `column-reverse`.

**6. Adjust Content Alignment:**
- Utilize `justify-content` to align items along the main axis (e.g., `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`).
- Use `align-items` to align items along the cross axis (e.g., `stretch`, `center`, `baseline`).

**7. Explore Flex Wrapping:**
- Apply `flex-wrap` to allow flex items to wrap onto multiple lines.
- Experiment with `nowrap`, `wrap`, and `wrap-reverse`.

**8. Build a Responsive Layout:**
- Create a responsive layout for a section of your webpage using Flexbox.
- Ensure that it adapts gracefully to different screen sizes.

**9. Test and Refine Your Layout:**
- Test your webpage in various browsers and devices to ensure the layout works as expected.
- Make any necessary adjustments for consistency and responsiveness.
