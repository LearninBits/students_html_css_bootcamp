#### Objective:
To enhance your webpage by incorporating organized lists and a simple table, deepening your understanding of HTML content structuring.

#### Tools Needed:
- Text editor (already installed).
- Web browser.

#### Instructions:

**1. Choose Content for Lists and Table:**
- **For Lists:** Select content that can be categorized or itemized, such as a to-do list, a list of favorite books, movies, etc.
- **For Table:** Decide on tabular data, like a schedule, product comparison, or any other information that fits well into a table format.

**2. Implement Lists:**
- **Add an Unordered List (bulleted):**
  - Use the `<ul>` tag to start an unordered list.
  - Inside, use `<li>` tags for each list item.
- **Add an Ordered List (numbered):**
  - Use the `<ol>` tag to start an ordered list.
  - Use `<li>` tags for each item as you did with the unordered list.
- **Customize List Style (Optional):**
  - Experiment with different list styles using CSS (e.g., different bullet types for `<ul>` or numbering formats for `<ol>`).

**3. Create a Simple Table:**
- **Structure Your Table:**
  - Start with the `<table>` tag.
  - Use `<tr>` tags to define table rows.
  - Within each row, use `<th>` tags for headers (if applicable) and `<td>` tags for table data.
- **Add Table Content:**
  - Fill in your headers (if any) and data cells with the content youâ€™ve chosen.
- **Enhance Table Appearance (Optional):**
  - Use basic CSS to style your table (e.g., border, cell padding, header styles).

**4. Integrate Lists and Table into Your Webpage:**
- Find appropriate sections in your existing webpage to add your list and table.
- Ensure they are logically placed and fit in with the rest of your content.

**5. Test Your Webpage:**
- Open your HTML file in a browser.
- Verify that the list and table are displaying correctly and fit well with the rest of the page layout.
