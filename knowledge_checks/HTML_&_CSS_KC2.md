### Knowledge Check: Building a Basic Webpage with Text, Headings, Images, and Links

#### Objective:
To create a webpage that incorporates various HTML elements including text, headings, images, and hyperlinks, to enhance your understanding of HTML and web page structuring.

#### Tools Needed:
- Text editor (installed in the previous assignment).
- Web browser.
- Access to the internet for image and link resources.

#### Instructions:

**1. Setup Your HTML File:**
- Open your text editor.
- Create a new HTML file or continue with your `index.html` from the previous assignment.
- Save your file in the same folder as before.

**2. Plan Your Webpage:**
- Decide on a theme or topic for your webpage (e.g., a hobby, a favorite place, a personal blog post).
- Outline the content to include:
  - A main heading (title of your page).
  - A few paragraphs of text.
  - At least one image related to your theme.
  - A couple of hyperlinks (these can be external links related to your topic).

**3. Structure Your Webpage:**
- **Add a Main Heading:**
  - Use an `<h1>` tag to create a main heading for your webpage.
- **Add Paragraphs:**
  - Use `<p>` tags to add a few paragraphs about your chosen topic.
- **Insert Images:**
  - Find an image online related to your topic or use any personal image.
  - Use the `<img>` tag to insert the image. Remember to include the `src` attribute for the image URL and an `alt` attribute describing the image.
- **Create Hyperlinks:**
  - Use `<a>` tags to add hyperlinks. Provide the URL in the `href` attribute and describe the link in the text between the opening and closing `<a>` tags.

**4. Enhance and Format Your Content:**
- **Format Text:**
  - Experiment with different headings (`<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc.) for sub-sections.
  - Emphasize some text using `<strong>` or `<em>` tags.
- **Arrange Your Image:**
  - Place your image appropriately within your content.
  - Adjust the size if needed using the `width` and `height` attributes in the `<img>` tag.

**5. Test Your Webpage:**
- Open your HTML file in a browser.
- Ensure that all elements are displaying correctly.
- Click on your hyperlinks to ensure they lead to the correct pages.

#### Submission Requirements:
- Submit the HTML file you created.
- Include a screenshot of your webpage as it appears in the browser.

#### Learning Outcomes:
- Understand and apply various HTML tags such as `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<img>`, and `<a>`.
- Develop skills in structuring and organizing content on a web page.
- Gain experience in embedding images and creating hyperlinks.

#### Tips:
- Remember to comment on your code to describe sections or specific elements.
- Validate your HTML using a service like W3C Markup Validation Service to ensure it's error-free.
