### Knowledge Check: Crafting a Responsive Webpage

#### Objective:
To enhance your existing webpage so that it adjusts and looks appealing on a variety of screen sizes, from desktop monitors to mobile phones.

#### Tools Needed:
- Text editor (already installed).
- Web browser.
- Access to developer tools in the browser for testing responsiveness (optional).

#### Instructions:

**1. Understand Responsive Design:**
- Review the concepts of responsive web design, focusing on fluid layouts, flexible images, and media queries.

**2. Set a Viewport Meta Tag:**
- In the `<head>` section of your HTML file, add `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`.
- This tag ensures your webpage scales correctly on different devices.

**3. Implement Fluid Layouts:**
- Adjust widths of elements (like divs, images, containers) to be percentage-based rather than fixed widths.
- Ensure images are scalable by setting their width to `max-width: 100%` and height to `auto`.

**4. Use Media Queries:**
- Introduce media queries in your CSS file using `@media` rule.
- Create breakpoints for different screen sizes (e.g., large desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Example: `@media screen and (max-width: 768px) { ... }` for tablet screens.

**5. Adjust Layout and Typography:**
- Within each media query block, adjust layout properties such as padding, margins, and display settings to enhance readability and usability.
- Scale font sizes and line heights to improve text readability on smaller screens.

**6. Test for Responsiveness:**
- Use the developer tools in your web browser to test how your webpage looks on different screen sizes.
- Alternatively, manually resize your browser window to see how the layout adjusts.

**7. Refine Your Design:**
- Based on your testing, refine and tweak the layout, fonts, and other design elements for each breakpoint to ensure a smooth user experience.

#### Submission Requirements:
- Submit the updated HTML and CSS files.
- Include screenshots of your webpage displayed on at least three different screen sizes (e.g., desktop, tablet, mobile).

#### Learning Outcomes:
- Understand and implement responsive web design principles.
- Learn to use media queries for creating device-specific layouts.
- Develop skills to ensure webpages are functional and visually appealing on various devices.

#### Tips:
- Focus on the most common screen sizes to start, and then you can expand to more specific breakpoints.
- Test your designs on actual devices if possible for a more accurate understanding of user experience.
- Keep the user experience at the forefront of your design process, ensuring that content is easily accessible and readable on all devices.
